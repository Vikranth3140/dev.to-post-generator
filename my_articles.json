    "body_markdown": "> \"Collaborating without version control is like trying to write a book with ten people using one typewriter.\"\n> \u2014 Vikranth (ig), 2024\n\nWhether you're a solo developer working on personal projects or part of a team building a large-scale application, how you manage your code can make or break your workflow. While storing code on your local laptop might feel straightforward, it comes with many risks and limitations. In this post, we'll explore why Git, a powerful version control system, is the better choice for managing your code.\n\n## The Risks of Storing Code Locally\n\nStoring your code solely on a laptop might seem convenient, but it has significant downsides:\n\n- **Data Loss**: Laptops can fail, get lost, or be stolen. If your code is only on your local machine, it's at risk of disappearing forever.\n- **Limited Collaboration**: Sharing code from a local machine is cumbersome, leading to inefficiencies, especially in team settings.\n- **No Backup**: Without regular backups, all your progress could be lost due to hardware failures or accidental deletion.\n- **Version Control Challenges**: Managing different versions of your code without a version control system is difficult, especially when you need to revert to a previous version or track changes.\n\n> Imagine spending weeks building a new feature, only to lose it because your laptop crashes, or worse, is stolen. If your code is only on your local machine, you risk losing all your hard work with no way to recover it. Plus, sharing and collaborating on code becomes a nightmare, often involving messy email threads or USB drives.\n\n## What is Git?\n\nGit is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes to your code. It allows developers to view the entire history of their project, making it easy to understand what changes were made and why. Unlike local storage, Git provides a distributed model, so every developer has a complete copy of the codebase, ensuring your code is safe even if something happens to your local machine.\n\n### Key Features of Git:\n- **Version Control**: Tracks every change, allowing developers to view the history of their code.\n- **Distributed System**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, providing redundancy and safety.\n\n## Why You Should Use Git Over Local Storage\n\n### 1. Data Integrity and Safety\n- Git ensures that your code is safe. Even if your laptop crashes, your work is backed up on a remote repository (e.g., [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)).\n- With the distributed nature of Git, there is no single point of failure. Each clone of the repository is a complete backup.\n\n### 2. Collaboration Made Easy\n- Developers can work on the same project simultaneously without stepping on each other\u2019s toes, thanks to Git's branch and merge capabilities.\n- Review processes are simplified through features like pull requests, where peers can review and comment on code changes.\n\n### 3. Version History and Reversibility\n- Every change is tracked, allowing developers to roll back to a previous state if a bug is introduced.\n- Developers can see who made specific changes and why, helping in debugging and project management.\n\n### 4. Branching for Better Workflow\n- Developers can create branches for different features or fixes, enabling parallel development.\n- Experimental features can be developed separately and merged once they're stable, without affecting the main codebase.\n\n> With Git, you're not just storing code; you're storing the entire history of your project. You can see exactly what was changed, when, and by whom, making collaboration and debugging significantly easier. Plus, features like branching allow multiple developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously, boosting productivity.\n\n## Popular Platforms for Using Git\n\nSeveral platforms make it easy to use Git and further enhance the experience:\n\n- **GitHub**: Integrates Git\u2019s capabilities with a user-friendly interface and additional features like issue tracking, CI/CD pipelines, and project management tools.\n- **GitLab**: Offers self-hosting options, DevOps tools, and integrated CI/CD pipelines.\n- **Bitbucket**: Integrates with Atlassian tools like Jira, making it a great choice for teams already using these products.\n\n> Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket have made Git more accessible than ever. They offer easy-to-use interfaces for managing repositories, collaborating on code, and automating workflows. These platforms turn Git into more than just a VCS \u2013 they become hubs for collaboration, project management, and continuous integration.\n\n## How to Get Started with Git\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide for readers who want to start using Git:\n\n1. **Install Git**: Follow the [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for your operating system.\n2. **Initialize a Repository**: \n   ```bash\n   git init\n   ```\n3. **Commit Changes**:\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n   ```\n4. **Create a Remote Repository**: Use GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to create a new repository.\n5. **Push to Remote**:\n   ```bash\n   git remote add origin <repository-url>\n   git push -u origin master\n   ```\n\n> Getting started with Git is straightforward. First, you'll need to install Git on your local machine. Then, initialize a repository, commit your changes, and push them to a remote platform like GitHub. Here\u2019s a quick step-by-step guide to set you on the right path.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you're serious about software development, managing your code properly is non-negotiable. Using Git instead of relying on local storage will not only protect your work from data loss but also enable easier collaboration, better version control, and a more efficient development process. So take the plunge, and start using Git today.\n\n---\n\nBy following the guidance in this post, you'll be able to safeguard your projects, collaborate more effectively, and streamline your coding workflow.

    "body_markdown": "_\"The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing.\"_ \u2014 Philip Fisher\n\nHave you ever wished for a seamless way to track real-time stock prices and financial data for NSE stocks directly in Google Sheets? Well, we did too! This led us on a journey to create a powerful Google Sheets script that fetches real-time stock prices, market cap, P/E ratio, and much more, using the [GOOGLEFINANCE](https://www.google.com/finance/) function. Here\u2019s our story and how you can use it to make your financial tracking a breeze.\n\n---\n\n### The Idea\n\nIt all started with a simple desire: to keep an eye on our favorite NSE stocks without jumping between multiple websites. We wanted everything in one place, preferably in Google Sheets, where we could easily manipulate and analyze the data. The idea was straightforward: automate the fetching of real-time stock data into Google Sheets, and that's exactly what we set out to achieve.\n\n### The Journey\n\nOur journey began with exploring the capabilities of the `GOOGLEFINANCE` function in Google Sheets. We discovered that while `GOOGLEFINANCE` supports various attributes like price, volume, and P/E ratio, it required us to manually enter each stock symbol and formula. This was tedious and time-consuming. We needed a way to automate this process.\n\n### The Solution\n\nWe decided to create a Google Apps Script that would:\n\n1. **Fetch real-time stock prices and financial data** for NSE stocks.\n2. **Automatically append `NSE:` to stock symbols** to ensure accurate results.\n3. **Clear previous data** to keep the sheet tidy.\n4. **Populate a predefined list of stock symbols** for easy setup.\n\n### How to Use Our Script\n\nWe\u2019ve made it incredibly easy for you to get started with our script. Follow these simple steps:\n\n1. **Open your Google Sheets document.**\n2. **Go to `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.**\n3. **Copy and paste the code** from our `Code.js` file into the Apps Script editor.\n4. **Save the script** by clicking the disk icon or pressing `Ctrl + S`.\n5. **Close the Apps Script editor and refresh your Google Sheets document.**\n6. **Enter stock symbols (without `NSE:`)** starting from cell A3.\n7. **Click on `Stock Prices` > `Update Prices`** to fetch and display stock data.\n\n### Features\n\nOur script fetches a wealth of data, including:\n\n- Real-time price\n- Percentage change\n- Volume\n- High and low prices\n- Open price\n- Market capitalization\n- Average daily trading volume\n- P/E ratio\n- Earnings per share\n- 52-week high and low\n- Previous day's closing price\n- Number of outstanding shares\n- Trade time\n- Data delay\n\n### Visual Guide\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of what your Google Sheets setup will look like:\n\n![Working Example](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b6qmefe6oec171izxhnl.png)\n\n**Description:**\n- The left side shows the stock symbols entered in column A.\n- The top menu shows the `Stock Prices` menu with the `Update Prices` option.\n\n### Pre-configured Sheet\n\nTo make things even simpler, we\u2019ve prepared a pre-configured Google Sheet with the script already set up. You can view and make a copy of it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lFifrj-Tz-uy5HfSLb8w6gkfa67wKtm-XMkU9gA29qk/edit?usp=sharing). The App Script is included, so you don't need to worry about setting up the code.\n\n### Video Tutorial\n\nFor those who prefer a visual guide, we\u2019ve got you covered! Check out our detailed video tutorial on how to use the script [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IUSCFHQpC6hRwfGvGHgsxXfry0T5IXRh/view?usp=sharing).\n\n### Going Beyond\n\nWe didn\u2019t stop at fetching data. We also created an additional script, `Populate.js`, to automatically populate a list of stock symbols. This script can be incredibly handy if you want to start with a predefined list of stocks.\n\n### Steps to Use Populate.js\n\n1. **Open your Google Sheets document.**\n2. **Go to `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.**\n3. **Copy and paste the code** from our `Populate.js` file into the Apps Script editor.\n4. **Save the script** by clicking the disk icon or pressing `Ctrl + S`.\n5. **Close the Apps Script editor and refresh your Google Sheets document.**\n6. **Run the `populateStocks` function** to automatically populate your list of NSE stocks starting from cell A3.\n\n### The Joy of Automation\n\nThis project was a joy to work on. The idea of automating something as tedious as manually entering stock data brought a smile to our faces. We hope it brings the same joy and convenience to you. \n\nCheck out the Github repo here - [Vikranth3140/NSE-Stock-Prices-Automation](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/NSE-Stock-Prices-Automation)\n\nFeel free to explore, tweak, and expand on our scripts. Automation can make financial tracking not just easier but also a lot more fun!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe hope our journey and this script inspire you to automate and simplify your own tasks. Happy tracking, and may your investments flourish!\n\n---\n\nThank you for joining us on this journey. If you have any questions or feedback, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Happy automating and investing!",

    "body_markdown": "> The blockchain is going to change everything more than the Internet has.\n- Brock Pierce\n\nBlockchain technology has been making waves across industries, presenting itself as a revolutionary force with the potential to transform various sectors. Recently, I had the opportunity to delve into this fascinating field by attending a blockchain workshop hosted by [BYLD](https://byld.iiitd.edu.in/) at [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/). The insights gained during this workshop not only sparked my curiosity but also inspired me to explore blockchain further.\n\nThe workshop provided a comprehensive overview of blockchain technology, covering its fundamental concepts, decentralized nature, cryptographic principles, and real-world applications. What intrigued me the most was the emphasis on blockchain's ability to create trust in a trustless environment, enabling secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nUpon returning from the workshop, I was eager to dive deeper into blockchain development. This is where the power of technology and AI came into play. Leveraging the assistance of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), I tried to build a simple blockchain implementation using Python.\n\n[GitHub - Simple Blockchain Implementation in Python](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/BlockChain)\n\n[ChatGPT Prompt Chat](https://chat.openai.com/share/b6854d29-6ec2-469f-939b-98d6f85ad983)\n\nThe first step was understanding the core components of a blockchain:\n\n1.  **Blocks**: Data containers that store information such as transactions, timestamps, and previous block hashes.\n2.  **Transactions**: Records of data exchanges between participants in the blockchain network.\n3.  **Mining**: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain through proof of work or other consensus mechanisms.\n4.  **Consensus**: Protocols that ensure agreement among network participants on the validity of transactions.\n\nWith this knowledge in hand, I began coding a basic blockchain system in Python. The implementation included functionalities like adding users, conducting transactions, mining blocks, verifying the chain's integrity, and exploring the blockchain's contents. ChatGPT played a crucial role in guiding me through the coding process, providing insights, suggestions, and code snippets to enhance the functionality and robustness of the blockchain.\n\nThe experience of building a blockchain from scratch was not only educational but also empowering. It highlighted the democratizing nature of technology, where anyone with curiosity and resources can venture into cutting-edge fields like blockchain development.\n\nIn conclusion, my journey from attending a blockchain workshop to creating a simple blockchain implementation underscores the significance of continuous learning, exploration, and leveraging technology to unlock new possibilities. As blockchain continues to evolve and gain traction, opportunities for innovation and disruption abound, making it an exciting field to watch and participate in.",

    "body_markdown": "> \"Leadership is not about being in charge. It's about taking care of those in your charge.\"\n- Simon Sinek\n\nBefore setting foot on my college campus, I was excited about taking on leadership roles, founding new clubs or student chapters, and representing esteemed companies as a campus ambassador. However, my enthusiasm was quickly dampened when I realized the lack of a centralized resource for accessing information about these opportunities. Navigating through numerous websites and platforms left me feeling overwhelmed and disheartened, with no clear pathway to pursue my aspirations.\n\nDetermined to overcome this challenge and simplify the process for fellow aspiring campus leaders, I embarked on a mission to create a solution. Recognizing the need for a curated resource that could streamline the search for campus leadership opportunities, I made a [GitHub](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/Campus-Leadership-Opportunities) repository to compile a comprehensive list of curated programs, chapters, and initiatives.\n\n![GitHub Repo Screenshot](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kik2cxg8zi3061mo7qvl.png)\n\nThis repository serves as a one-stop destination where students can easily explore a diverse range of opportunities tailored to their interests and ambitions. Whether it's representing leading tech companies as a campus ambassador, initiating coding clubs on campus, or joining student chapters dedicated to social impact, the repository offers many options to suit every individual's goals.\n\nMy vision for this repository goes beyond just providing information; it aims to empower students with the resources they need to kickstart their leadership journey. By centralizing these opportunities on GitHub, I aim to eliminate the barriers that hinder my pursuit of campus leadership roles, ensuring that future generations of students have access to the tools and support they need to thrive.\n\nAs I continue to expand and update the repository, I invite fellow students and campus leaders to join me in this collaborative effort. Together, we can build a vibrant community where opportunities abound, and aspiring leaders are nurtured and supported in their endeavours.\n\nLet's heed Simon Sinek's words and embrace the true essence of leadership \u2013 not just by being in charge, but by caring for those entrusted to our guidance. Join me on this journey of empowerment, growth, and leadership as we pave the way for a brighter future on college campuses everywhere.\n\nFeel free to check out the GitHub repository here - [GitHub - Campus Leadership Opportunities](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/Campus-Leadership-Opportunities).",

We've encountered multiple implementation challenges, and we're eager to share our experiences and unique insights into forecasting the future value of Bitcoin.\n\n### Initial Model:\n\nIn our first attempt, we built a model centred around the first day's open value of Bitcoin. Our approach sought to measure the predictive power of this single feature in forecasting future prices. We aimed to predict the high value solely based on the open value, followed by the low value based on open and high value. Additionally, we ventured into predicting the volume value based on open, high, and low values. Finally, we forecasted the close for the day, which would become the open value for the next day.\n\nUnfortunately, the predictions from this model weren't accurate, deviating significantly from the testing dataset.\n\n![Initial Model](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7v11hcaq5zw6qcnrskm4.jpg)\n\n### Enhanced Model:\n\nUndeterred, we refined our approach by incorporating two features: the open price and the volume traded on the respective day. This enhanced model aimed to capture additional market dynamics, resulting in predicted values that closely aligned with the actual dataset and exhibited significantly reduced deviation.\n\n![Enhanced Model](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9iim2sdwabnquo6vy1ew.jpg)\n\n### Dataset Transition:\n\nWe initially used [Cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) for our dataset, but we found that the data from [yfinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and [ccxt](https://docs.ccxt.com/#/) provided more reliability. Consequently, we made the shift, improving our predictions' accuracy.\n\nExcitingly, we expanded our project to include USDT and Ethereum as well. This extension opens up new possibilities for accurate predictions in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nOverall, the journey has been rewarding, and we're committed to returning, refining the prediction model, and incorporating more features.\n\nCheck out our project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/CoinSavvy/). You can get hands-on experience with both models by cloning our repository. Experiment, tweak, and contribute to the evolution of CoinSavvy.\n\n### Contributors:\n\n@vikranth3140 \n@fakepickle \n@noeltiju \n@mehul-ag20\n\nThank you for joining us on this exciting ride.

    "body_markdown": "Hey Coders,\n\nSo, back in my first semester, I was working on this project with a couple of buddies for an Intro to Programming course. We chose [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and [News API](https://newsapi.org/) \u2013 you know, to keep things interesting. The goal was to whip up a tool that fetched real-time weather data and top news headlines. Not groundbreaking stuff, but a solid start in the world of APIs.\n\n[GitHub - Weather and News Python Mini Project](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/Weather-and-News-API.git)\n\n![The Terminal snapshot of the Mini Project](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5cm9ubkwgx2mshqysap2.png)\n\nA bit down the road, during a hackathon, I decided to give [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) a spin. I put together a basic Weather Tracker using the OpenWeatherMap API. Streamlit turned out to be a handy tool \u2013 straightforward, effective, and perfect for turning data into interactive web apps.\n\n[GitHub - Streamlit Weather Tracker](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/Weather-Tracker.git)\n\n![The Streamlit snapshot of the Streamlit Weather Tracker](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/874x2fyohwr8vfzggm66.png)\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. After a bit of a break, I thought, \"Why not bring these two projects together?\" Take the weather and news API from the first, blend it with Streamlit features from the second, and there you have it \u2013 **CityInsight**.\n\n[GitHub - CityInsight](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/CityInsight.git)\n\n![The Streamlit snapshot of the Final Streamlit Weather and News Tracker](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ror1067egnmn80atf4ne.png)\n\nThis project isn't a groundbreaking feat, but it's my little step into the world of personal open-source development. Dealing with different APIs, navigating through Streamlit, and merging codes \u2013 it was like putting together a tech puzzle.\n\nChallenges? Yeah, a few. Wrapping my head around different APIs, understanding Streamlit quirks, and getting the codes to cooperate \u2013 it wasn't a walk in the park. But hey, every challenge is a lesson in the coding world, right?\n\nSo, here I am, throwing **CityInsight** out there. It might not be the next big thing, but it's a thing. If you're curious or want to throw in your two cents, feel free to jump in. Let's make coding a tad more interesting.\n\n[GitHub - CityInsight](https://github.com/Vikranth3140/CityInsight.git)\n\nSee you in the code!",
