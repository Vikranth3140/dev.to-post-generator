# Automating Real-time Weather Updates for Multiple Cities using IFTTT and Google Sheets

If you're a frequent traveler or simply someone who keeps an eye on weather conditions in multiple locations, managing real-time weather updates can be a tedious task. In this post, we will show you how to automate the process of getting real-time weather updates for various cities using IFTTT (If This Then That) and Google Sheets.

## What is IFTTT?

IFTTT stands for "If This Then That." It's a web-based service that allows you to create custom automated workflows, called *Applets*. These Applets connect different online services, so when one service performs a specific action (the "if" part), another service is triggered to perform a desired action (the "then" part).

## Setting Up the Workflow

### Step 1: Create a Weather Channel on IFTTT

To get started, you'll need to create a new channel for weather updates on your IFTTT account. Here's how:

- Log into your IFTTT account or sign up if you don't have one.
- Go to the "Channels" tab and search for "Weather Underground."
- Connect your Weather Underground account by providing your API key (you can get it from their website).
- Once connected, create a new recipe using the "If This Then That" service.

### Step 2: Create the Applet

In this step, we will configure the "If" part of our Applet to trigger when weather updates are available for your chosen cities.

- Click on "New Applet" and search for the Weather Underground channel.
- Choose a trigger event that corresponds to the weather update you're interested in (e.g., "Current weather conditions change").
- Select the city for which you want real-time updates and click on "Create Trigger."

### Step 3: Define the Action

In this step, we will define what happens when the trigger event occurs (the "Then" part). For our purposes, we'll use Google Sheets to store and manage our weather data.

- Click on "+ that" to add a new action service.
- Search for Google Sheets and connect your account by providing the necessary credentials.
- Choose an action that corresponds to adding a row in a Google Spreadsheet (e.g., "Add Row").
- In the fields provided, specify the location of your spreadsheet and the columns where you want to store the weather data (city name, temperature, humidity, etc.).
- Click on "Create Action" to finalize the Applet setup.

### Step 4: Activate the Workflow

Now that everything is set up, activate your workflow by turning it ON in the IFTTT app or website. You should start receiving real-time weather updates for your chosen cities in your Google Spreadsheet automatically.

## Customizing Your Applet

You can customize your Applet to suit your specific needs by adding multiple cities, changing the trigger event, or modifying the action service. For example, you could use a different service like OpenWeatherMap for weather updates if Weather Underground doesn't support the city you're interested in.

## Conclusion

By automating real-time weather updates using IFTTT and Google Sheets, you can streamline your workflow and stay informed about the weather conditions in multiple locations without lifting a finger. Happy automating!
