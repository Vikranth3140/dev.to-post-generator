In this article, I'll share my journey of creating a custom stock portfolio tracker using the powerful Alpaca API. As a tech-savvy investor, I was frustrated with the limitations of existing solutions and decided to build something tailored to my needs. Let's dive in!

I started by setting up an account on [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) and familiarizing myself with their API documentation. I found that the API allowed me to access real-time market data, place orders, and manage my portfolio all within a single platform.

Next, I chose Python as my programming language because of its simplicity and versatility. Using the Alpaca Python SDK, I wrote a script that fetched my current portfolio's data and visualized it using matplotlib. To make the tracker interactive, I added functionality to update the portfolio in real-time.

Challenges arose when I had to handle API authentication and rate limits. However, after some trial and error, I was able to successfully implement these features using OAuth2 and exponential backoff strategies.

Here's a peek at my final project:

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Initialize Alpaca API client
api = tradeapi.REST('<API-KEY>', '<API-SECRET-KEY>')
portfolio = api.get_account()['portfolio']

# Fetch and visualize data
portfolio_value = sum([position['cash'] + position['equity'] for position in portfolio])
plt.plot([0, len(portfolio)], [portfolio_value, portfolio_value], color='g')
plt.show()
```

This project has been a valuable addition to my investment strategy, and I hope sharing my experience encourages other coders to build their custom portfolio trackers. You can find the complete code for this project in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your_username/stock-portfolio-tracker). Happy coding!
