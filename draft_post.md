# Free Agentic AI Learning via Ollama: A Hands-On Guide for Developers

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize the Ollama framework to develop an agentic AI system capable of self-learning and adapting to new environments. By the end of this article, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement and train your own agentic AI using Ollama.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

1. A modern Python environment (3.7+) installed on your computer.
2. [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/) libraries for reinforcement learning tasks.
3. [Ollama](https://ollamalabs.com/), the open-source framework for agentic AI development.
4. Basic knowledge of Python, machine learning, and reinforcement learning concepts.

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, let's set up our environment by installing the necessary libraries. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt.

```bash
pip install gym stable_baselines ollama
```

Next, clone the Ollama repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ollamalabs/ollama.git
cd ollama
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now that our environment is set up, let's dive into developing an agentic AI system using Ollama!

## Creating a Custom Environment

In order to train an agent with Ollama, we need to define a custom environment. For this tutorial, we will create a simple 2D maze navigation task.

```python
import gym
from ollama import AgenticAI

class MazeNavigation(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the Gym environment
        self.env = gym.make('Maze-v0')

        # Initialize the agent
        self.agent = AgenticAI()

    def reset(self):
        # Reset the environment and return initial state
        self.env.reset()
        return self.state()

    def step(self, action):
        # Execute an action and return new state, reward, done, info
        state, reward, done, info = self.env.step(action)
        # Update the agent's model with experience from this step
        self.agent.experience((state, action, reward, state, done))
        return state, reward, done, info
```

## Training the Agentic AI

Now that we have our custom environment set up, let's train our agent using Ollama. We will create a simple trainer function to handle this process.

```python
import time

def train(agent, env, max_episodes=1000):
    total_rewards = []
    for i in range(max_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = agent.act(state)
            state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            total_rewards.append(reward)
    return total_rewards
```

Finally, let's use our `train()` function to train the agent on the maze navigation task:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create the environment and agent
    env = MazeNavigation()
    agent = AgenticAI()

    # Train the agent for a specified number of episodes
    rewards = train(agent, env, max_episodes=1000)
```

## Evaluating the Agent

After training the agent, we can evaluate its performance by allowing it to navigate through the maze a few times.

```python
def evaluate(agent, env, num_episodes=5):
    total_rewards = 0
    for _ in range(num_episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        while not done:
            action = agent.act(state)
            state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            total_rewards += reward
    return total_rewards / num_episodes
```

You can now call the `evaluate()` function to see how well your trained agent performs:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Evaluate the agent after training for a specified number of episodes
    print(f'Average reward over {num_episodes} evaluations: {evaluate(agent, env, num_episodes=5)}')
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to utilize the Ollama framework for developing agentic AI systems capable of self-learning and adapting to new environments. We created a simple 2D maze navigation task, trained an agent using our custom environment and Ollama, and evaluated its performance. With this knowledge, you can now explore more complex tasks, such as robotic manipulation or game playing agents, using the powerful toolset provided by Ollama!

Happy coding, and happy learning! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
