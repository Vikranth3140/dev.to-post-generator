# How to Implement Real-Time Cryptocurrency Tracking with Google Sheets and Google Apps Script

   In this step-by-step tutorial, we will show you how to automate the process of fetching real-time cryptocurrency prices in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script. This guide is perfect for intermediate to advanced users who are familiar with Google Sheets and want to expand their skills by automating tasks related to tracking cryptocurrencies.

   ## Prerequisites

   Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:

   - A Google account and access to Google Sheets
   - Basic understanding of Google Apps Script (JavaScript)
   - Knowledge of how to use APIs, specifically CoinGecko API

   ## Step 1: Set Up Your Google Sheet

   Start by creating a new Google Spreadsheet. Name the sheet as "Crypto Prices Tracker." In this tutorial, we will be using columns for cryptocurrency names and their corresponding prices.

   ## Step 2: Enable Google Apps Script

   Click on "Extensions" > "Apps Script." This will open the Google Apps Script Editor in a new tab.

   ## Step 3: Write the Code

   In the Google Apps Script Editor, create a new function to fetch the real-time prices of selected cryptocurrencies from CoinGecko API. Replace `YOUR_COIN_IDS` with the IDs of the cryptocurrencies you want to track.

   ```javascript
   function getCryptoPrices() {
       const coinIds = ['bitcoin', 'ethereum', 'ripple']; // YOUR_COIN_IDS
       const urlBase = 'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price';

       let response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(urlBase + '?ids=' + coinIds.join(',') + '&vs_currencies=usd');
       const data = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());

       // Write the fetched data into your Google Sheet
   }
   ```

   ## Step 4: Schedule the Script

   To run this script automatically every hour (or any preferred interval), click on "Triggers" in the sidebar of the Google Apps Script Editor. Set up a new trigger for the `getCryptoPrices` function to be called every hour.

   With these steps, you now have a real-time cryptocurrency tracking solution in your Google Sheets! You can customize the script further by adding more cryptocurrencies to track, changing the updating interval, or even integrating it with other tools for notifications and alerts.
